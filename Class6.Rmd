# Logistic Regression

```{r}

# Zscores and Correlation

A correlation.... a regression with standardized variables!

```{r}
d$Familiarity.Z = (d$Familiarity - mean(d$Familiarity))/sd(d$Familiarity)
d$RTms.Z = (d$RTms - mean(d$RTms))/sd(d$RTms)
summary(lm(data=d, RTms.Z ~ Familiarity.Z))
cor(d$Familiarity.Z, d$RTms.Z)
