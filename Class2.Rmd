## This is a header

Here is some text.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Try it Yourself: Tidyverse Review

Load english.csv to get our lexical decision time data. RTms is the reaction time in milliseconds (one thousandth of a second).

Familiarity is the average familiarity rating for each word. AgeSubject comes in two categories: "young" and "old". Each RTms is the average reaction time (over 30 subjects) for that word.

Using filter() and select() and arrange() and %in% [look up how to use arrange and %in% with ?arrange], get the RT data for "puck", "gong", and "treat" and show it with just the following columns: Word, RTms, AgeSubject, Familiarity. 
Sort in the order of RTms.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
d = read_csv("english.csv")
d$RTms = exp(d$RTlexdec)
#filter(d, Word == "puck" |
#         Word == "gong" | 
#         Word == "treat")

filtered_d = filter(d, Word %in% c("puck", "gong", "treat")) %>%
  select(Word, RTms, AgeSubject, Familiarity) %>%
  arrange(RTms)
#TODO: your code here

filtered_d
```

## Try it Yourself: Histogram Practice

1. Make a histogram of just the RTms data from the "young" subjects.
2. Now just the "old".

```{r}
young = filter(d, AgeSubject == "young")
hist(young$RTms)
```

## Some more important tidyverse functions

### group_by and summarise

```{r}
mean(d$RTms)

group_by(d, AgeSubject, WordCategory) %>%
  summarise(meanRT = mean(RTms),
            medianRT = median(RTms),
            maxRT = max(RTms),
            minRT = min(RTms),
            meanWrittenFrequency = mean(WrittenFrequency)) %>%
  select(AgeSubject, WordCategory, meanWrittenFrequency)


```


### group_by and mutate

 - summarise: return fewer rows than original
 - mutate: return same number of rows as original, with new column

```{r}
group_by(d, AgeSubject) %>%
  mutate(meanRT.byage = mean(RTms),
         diff.from.age.mean = RTms - meanRT.byage) %>%
  select(Word, RTms, meanRT.byage, diff.from.age.mean) %>%
  arrange(-diff.from.age.mean)

group_by(d, AgeSubject) %>%
  mutate(meanRT.byage = mean(RTms)) %>%
  select(AgeSubject, meanRT.byage)
```

# Learning ggplot

```{r}
# scatterplot: geom_point()
ggplot(d, aes(x=Familiarity, y=RTms, colour=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_point() 
```

```{r}
# violin plot (powerful but violin plots are not so useful in many cases)
ggplot(d, aes(x=Familiarity, y=RTms, colour=AgeSubject, fill=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_violin() 
```

```{r}
# plot that makes points....and then add lines
ggplot(d, aes(x=Familiarity, y=RTms, colour=AgeSubject, fill=AgeSubject, group=Word)) +
  geom_line(colour="red") + 
  geom_point()  
```

```{r}
# histogram
(ggplot(d, aes(x=RTms, fill=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_histogram() )
```

```{r}
# now do the colored histogram by word
ggplot(d, aes(x=RTms, fill=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic(12)

head(d)

read_csv("english.csv") %>%
  mutate(RTms = exp(RTlexdec)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=RTms, fill=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic(12)
```

# Try it Yourself: ggplot

Make a scatterplot showing RTms "as a function of" WrittenFrequency.

Then do the same with just "young" subjects (or use color to separate them). Compare the plots.

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x=WrittenFrequency, y=RTms, colour=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_point(colour="brick")
```

# Try it Yourself: A harder ggplot

Take smallset and plot RTms vs. Familiarity, but use geom_text() [look it up!] to put the Words onto the plots. 

```{r}
smallset = sample_n(d, 60)
ggplot(d, aes(x=WrittenFrequency, y=RTms, colour=AgeSubject, label=Word)) +
  geom_text()
```
 exploring mystery:
```{r}
filter(d, Word == "jape"| Word == "skiff")
```
