## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Try it Yourself: Tidyverse Review

Load english.csv to get our lexical decision time data. RTms is the reaction time in milliseconds (one thousandth of a second).

Familiarity is the average familiarity rating for each word. AgeSubject comes in two categories: "young" and "old". Each RTms is the average reaction time (over 30 subjects) for that word.

Using filter() and select() and arrange() and %in% [look up how to use arrange and %in% with ?arrange], get the RT data for "puck", "gong", and "treat" and show it with just the following columns: Word, RTms, AgeSubject, Familiarity. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
d = read_csv("english.csv")
d$RTms = exp(d$RTlexdec)
#TODO: your code here
```

## Try it Yourself: Histogram Practice

Make a histogram of just the RTms data from the "young" subjects. Now just the "old".

```{r}
```

## Some more important tidyverse functions

### group_by and summarise

```{r}
```


### group_by and mutate

```{r}
```

# Learning ggplot

```{r}
# scatterplot: geom_point()
ggplot(d, aes(x=Familiarity, y=RTms, colour=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_point() 
```

```{r}
# violin plot (powerful but violin plots are not so useful in many cases)
ggplot(d, aes(x=RTms, y=Familiarity, fill=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_violin() 
```

```{r}
# plot that makes points....and then add lines
ggplot(d, aes(x=RTms, y=Familiarity, colour=AgeSubject, group=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()  
```

```{r}
# histogram
(ggplot(d, aes(x=RTms, fill=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_histogram() )
```

```{r}
# now do the colored histogram by word
ggplot(d, aes(x=RTms, fill=AgeSubject)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic(12)

head(d)
```

# Try it Yourself: ggplot

Make a scatterplot showing RTms "as a function of" WrittenFrequency.

Then do the same with just "young" subjects. Compare the plots.

```{r}
```

# Try it Yourself: A harder ggplot

Take smallset and plot RTms vs. Familiarity, but use geom_text() [look it up!] to put the Words onto the plots. 

```{r}
smallset = sample_n(d, 60)
```

# Rearranging DataFrames

Let's look at words that are especially different between young and old people. Let's do it by creating a data frame with these columns: Word,Young,Old where the values are RTms.

Do it for just nouns!

```{r}
```

# Starting some summary stats: Understanding mean, median, and standard deviation (sd)

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 100000000)
```

# Uniform and normal

```{r}
u = runif(10000, 0, 1)
n = rnorm(10000, 0, 1)

d = tibble(unif=u, norm=n)
```

# Make some different histograms by taking the mean of the uniform distribution. 

```{r}
```

# Exercise

Take 10000 draws from a uniform distribution [0, 1]. Find the 2.5 percentile, 50th percentile, 97.5th percentile empirically (by computing it). That is: find the value for which 2.5% of the data is less than that value. Then for 50% (this is the median!), etc. 

Now do the same for a normal distribution. Keep the mean 0, but play around with the standard deviation (try 1, 2, 3). How does this affect things?

```{r}
```
